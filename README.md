> Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century or more.

## Getting Started

I have not managed to run this applet on any browser including IE8. The only way that seems to be working is to install appletviewer from openjdk-8-jdk package on Linux. You can run it on Windows using appletviewer from Oracle Java SE.
